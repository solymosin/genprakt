    abstract = {Author Summary Transcription factors are critical proteins for sequence-specific control of transcriptional regulation. Finding where these proteins bind to DNA is of key importance for global efforts to decipher the complex mechanisms of gene regulation. Greater understanding of the regulation of transcription promises to improve human genetic analysis by specifying critical gene components that have eluded investigators. Classically, computational prediction of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) is based on models giving weights to each nucleotide at each position. We introduce a novel statistical model for the prediction of TFBS tolerant of a broader range of TFBS configurations than can be conveniently accommodated by existing methods. The new models are designed to address the confounding properties of nucleotide composition, inter-positional sequence dependence and variable lengths (e.g. variable spacing between half-sites) observed in the more comprehensive experimental data now emerging. The new models generate scores consistent with DNA-protein affinities measured experimentally and can be represented graphically, retaining desirable attributes of past methods. It demonstrates the capacity of the new approach to accurately assess DNA-protein interactions. With the rich experimental data generated from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, a greater diversity of TFBS properties has emerged that can now be accommodated within a single predictive approach.},

abstract="Dramatic progress in deciphering the regulatory controls in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been enabled by the fusion of high-throughput genomics technologies with advanced sequence analysis algorithms. Sets of genes likely to function together and with similar expression profiles have been identified in diverse studies. By fusing an advanced pattern recognition algorithm for identification of transcription factor binding sites with a new method for the quantitative comparison of binding properties of transcription factors, we provide an integrated means to move from expression data to biological insights. The Yeast Regulatory Sequence Analysis system, YRSA, combines standard functions with a novel pattern characterization procedure in an intuitive interface designed for use by a broad range of scientists. The features of the system include automated retrieval of user-defined promoter sequences, binding site discovery by pattern recognition, graphical displays of the observed pattern and positions of similar sequences in the specified genes, and comparison of the new pattern against a collection of binding patterns for characterized transcription factors. The comprehensive YRSA system was used to study the regulatory mechanisms of yeast regulons. Analysis of the regulatory controls of a battery of genes induced by DNA damaging agents supports a putative mediating role for the cell-cycle checkpoint regulatory element MCB. YRSA is available at                   http://yrsa.cgb.ki.se                                  . [YRSA: ancient Scandinavian name meaning old she-bear (Latin Ursus arctos = brown bear/grizzly).]",

@article{Dobin2013,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.
